<P><B>If you see highlighted areas on the map:</B></P>
<P>The sites highlighted on the map are areas of the watershed that we expect to
become wet enough to generate overland runoff over the next three
days.  Because they will transmit water quickly to receiving streams
and lakes, these have the highest risk to transport contaminants and
cause water quality problems.  It is a good idea to avoid
potentially-polluting activities in these areas over the next few
days.    
</P>

<P><I>Activities to
avoid in highlighted land:</I></P>
<ul>
<li>Spreading manure</li>
<li>Fertilizer
application</li>
<li>Pesticide spraying</li>
<li>Pasturing animals</li>
</ul>

<P>Keep in mind, these
predictions are not perfect.  If you know the land around you well,
you can probably find some inaccuracies - particularly in areas that
have been altered by tile drains.  When runoff is predicted, avoid
polluting activities in areas of the land that you know to be
generally wet even if they don't show up as red here.</P>



<P><B>Questions and comments</B></P>
<P>We are very
interested in feedback about this site.  How can we make it more
useful?  Are our predictions really wrong in some areas?  Are we
generally getting the wet areas right near you?  We'd love to know
what you think.  Please contact us with your comments or questions!</P>
